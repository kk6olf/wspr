# WSPR and Convolutional Encoding Examples
These IPython notebooks were created as part of a presentation to the [Marin Amateur Radio Society](http://w6sg.net/site/) on Feb 2, 2018.
The [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uevpHx_y8AqFnAwbrZcy6MRrAOJG1qw4kIzj6M7FgyQ/edit#slide=id.g329096d8a6_0_0) walks through the steps involved in generating WSPR 4FSK transmissions, focusing on the Convolutional Codes used as the forward error correcting (FEC) mechanism that allows WSPR to recover from errors in the received data.
